<p>My brief:<br>
  When I was a teenager, I bought a Mac -my first personal computer. <br> 
  It influenced me a lot. More than helping me to learn about computers, <br>
  it opened my eyes to see the world of technology and product design.<br>
  Since then, I spent lot of time, studying and prototyping products, <br> learning about people and the process that went into their making.
  I believe, <br><b>products and makers are vital constructors of the modern world</b>.
  <br><br>
  On later days, I made<br>
  -websites and a media player for desktop [Java, SWT]. <br>
  -a Web based project management tool [Java for backend & JS for front]. <br>
  -an app that let's you organize your online content based on topics [Python & JS]. <br>
  <br>
  currently, I'm working on things for mobileðŸ“±
