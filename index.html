<p>About:
  My early teenage years were greatly influenced by a video <br> game console and then a Mac, my first computer. 
  Since then, <br> I spent lot of time, prototyping and studying about products and <br>the process that went into thier making.
  I believe, <br>products and people who make, are vital constructors of the modern world.
  <br>
  On later days, I made<br>
  -websites and a media player for desktop [Java SWT]. <br>
  -a Web based project management tool [Java for backend & JS for front]. <br>
  -an app that let's you organize your online content based on topics [Python & JS] <br>
  <br>
  currently, I'm working on things for mobile and tools for the makers ðŸš€
