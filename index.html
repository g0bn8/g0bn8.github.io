    <br><b> ▪ little about me</b>
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ⬩ I am interested in Knowledge Representation, Generative Art/Code/Data, Game Design and Learning agents
    <br>
    <br><b> ▪ things that I did/doing</b>
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • taggya : context over content, made by tags
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ⬩ an app that aggregates content across services like Google Maps, Gmail and twitter
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ⬩ started on 2012 and shutdown on 2013 due to lack of traction
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • <a href="https://twitter.com/snippost">snippost</a> : A curation of snippets that are easily applicable or memorable distillations
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • <a href="https://bldr.bar/">bldr.bar</a> : tools for software development
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ⬩ started building from Jan 2021       
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ⬩ currently testing the early features and looking out for inputs
    <br>
    <br><b> ▪ some mental models</b>
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • the main <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6BsiVyC1kM" target="_blank">value of values</a> is: values value
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • change = (consistency)<sup>compound</sup>
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wfBxUQKtxc" target="_blank">greatness and uselessness cannot coexist</a>
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • constraints are templates for progress
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • 20% of (right)input => 80% of output
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • It takes 100 'No's for every 'Yes'
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • slow is smooth; smooth is fast
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • demand sets the context for good/bad    
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • 0 step forward = 2 steps backward
      <br> &nbsp &nbsp • systems<sub>processes</sub> <=> <sub>metrics</sub>goals
    <br>
