<p>About:
  My early teenage years were greatly influenced by a video game console and then a Mac, my first computer. 
  Since then I spent lot of time, prototyping and studying about products and the process thst went into thier making.

  I made a media player for desktop and few websites using Java.
  Web based project management software using Javs for bsckend and JS fir front.
